ğŸ‘‹ Hi I'm HorvÃ¡th PÃ©ter (Maybe it's easier to call me Yeru) and I'm here to upload my stuff here, but maybe you can learn from that stuff.

ğŸ‘€ I'm intrested in almost any kind of things related to programming, like AI stuff, server and database management and ethical hacking, although yet I can only use a very few types of languages (html, css, js, python, node, mongo (Yes, that's all, don't laugh)), but I'm really into learning more langs.

ğŸŒ± I'm currently (06. 2022.) leraning Cloud firestore, Firebase auth and Angular. After than I'm planning to start a bigger project.

ğŸ“« If you want to reach me for some wierd reason you can write me an email about it to: yeru065077@gmail.com
